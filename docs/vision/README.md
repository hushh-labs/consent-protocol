# Hushh Vision

> Where this is going. Philosophy, product roadmap, and community strategy.

## The Hushh Principle

_"An agent should work for the person whose life it touches."_

Every product decision, GTM story, and policy stance ladders up to this principle. Hushh is a category, not a character.

## What Hushh Is

**Hushh is your Personal Data Agent (PDA)** -- a fiduciary intelligence.

An agent that:

- Acts on your behalf, bound by consent
- Treats your data as your private capital
- Optimizes outcomes across your life, not just tasks
- Runs hybrid: on-device reasoning with optional cloud data access
- Is accountable only to you

| Old World                    | Hushh World                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Shadow dossiers              | Transparent data vaults             |
| Extraction without value     | Value exchange with consent         |
| Intelligence without consent | Consent before intelligence         |
| Data on their servers        | Data encrypted, keys in your hands  |

## Community Strategy: Discord

### Channel Architecture

**START**
- `#index` -- Tech stack, links, and warnings (read-only)
- `#rules` -- Community guidelines (read-only)
- `#manifesto` -- Core philosophy and vision (read-only)

**ENGINEERING**
- `#builders` -- Dev discussion, operon building, tech deep-dives
- `#compliance` -- Consent protocol, token logic, ADK/AP2 standards
- `#beta-testing` -- TestFlight / APK feedback and bug reports

**LABS**
- `#general` -- Main community chat
- `#conference-1` -- Voice channel for pair programming

### Builder Engagement

The Discord is designed to convert passive users into active builders:

1. **Index** establishes the tech stack and contribution paths
2. **Builders** provides a space for operon development and review
3. **Compliance** ensures community contributions meet consent standards
4. **Beta-testing** provides direct feedback from real users

### The Golden Operon Campaign

Community members who build useful, modular operons get:
- Recognition in the global repo
- Featured at demo showcases
- Potential inclusion in the core platform

See [Agent Development](../../consent-protocol/docs/reference/agent-development.md) for how to build operons and agents.
