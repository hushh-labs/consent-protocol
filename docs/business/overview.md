# Hushh - How It Works

> A plain-English guide for anyone to understand Hushh

---

## What is Hushh?

Hushh is your **personal data vault** - a secure place where YOU control your information. Think of it like a safety deposit box at a bank, but for your digital data.

### The Problem We Solve

Every app today collects your data - your preferences, habits, purchases. But:

- You don't know what they store
- You can't access it
- You can't delete it
- They can sell it

**Hushh flips this.** Your data lives in YOUR vault. Apps ask YOU for permission.

---

## How Does It Work?

### 1. Your Vault

When you create a Hushh account:

```
📱 You → Login with Google → Create a master passphrase → Done!
```

Your passphrase is like a key to a safe. **We never see it.** Even if someone hacked our servers, they'd only find encrypted gibberish.

### 2. AI Assistants (Agents)

Hushh has helpful AI assistants that can:

- 🍕 **Food Agent**: Remember your dietary preferences, allergies, favorite cuisines
- 💼 **Professional Agent**: Store your skills, experience, career goals
- 🛍️ **Shopping Agent**: Track your shopping preferences

These agents work FOR you, not for advertisers.

### 3. Permission System

Before any agent can save data to your vault, you see a permission prompt:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔐 Permission Request             │
│                                     │
│  "Food Agent wants to save your    │
│   dietary preferences"             │
│                                     │
│  [Deny]           [Allow]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**You choose. Always.**

## Security - In Plain English

### Your Passphrase

| What We Know                            | What We DON'T Know  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Your email (for login)                  | Your passphrase     |
| Encrypted data (looks like random text) | The actual contents |
| That you have a vault                   | What's in it        |

### If You Forget Your Passphrase

When you first sign up, you get a **Recovery Key** like:

```
HRK-A1B2-C3D4-E5F6-G7H8
```

Keep this somewhere safe (write it down, save in password manager). It's your backup key.

### Why This Is Safe

1. **Zero-Knowledge**: We can't read your data even if we wanted to
2. **Strong Encryption**: Same technology banks use (AES-256)
3. **Your Control**: You can delete everything anytime
