# Resume Generation System Rules

## Context
This project auto-generates ATS-optimized .docx resumes from YAML data files.

## Architecture
- **Data Source**: YAML files in `data/` directory (profile, experience, projects, skills, achievements, education)
- **Generators**: Python modules in `generators/` for processing and document generation
- **Output**: .docx files in `output/` directory with versioned copies in `output/versions/`

## When user says "update resume" or "generate resume":
1. Read data/*.yaml files to understand current resume content
2. Run: `python scripts/generate_resume.py`
3. Validate ATS compliance automatically
4. Report: "✅ Resume generated: output/Resume_Kushal_Latest.docx"
5. Display validation results

## When user says "validate resume":
1. Run: `python scripts/validate_ats.py output/Resume_Kushal_Latest.docx`
2. Display detailed validation report with passed checks, warnings, and errors

## When user wants to update resume content:
1. Identify which YAML file needs updates (profile, experience, projects, skills, etc.)
2. Edit the appropriate YAML file in `data/` directory
3. Automatically run `python scripts/generate_resume.py` to regenerate resume
4. Show before/after comparison if requested

## Sensitive Language Rules for AI/ML Experience:

### ✅ USE:
- "Founding Engineer" (accurate, impressive)
- "Built AI-powered platform with ML pipeline"
- "Architected complete ML pipeline"
- "Achieved [X]% model accuracy"
- "Implemented [technology] for [compliance/requirement]"
- "Integrated [N] OAuth providers"
- "Built using AI-assisted development (Cursor)"

### ❌ NEVER USE:
- "AI/ML Expert" (without context)
- "Machine Learning Specialist"
- "Deep Learning Engineer"
- Overstatement of expertise
- Claims of "training models from scratch" without context

### Context:
User is a Founding Engineer who is learning AI/ML through Cursor-assisted development and implementation. Position as a systems engineer who built an ML platform, not as a traditional ML researcher or data scientist.

## ATS Compliance Requirements:
- **Format**: .docx only (not PDF)
- **Fonts**: Calibri, Arial, Georgia only
- **Layout**: Single column, no text boxes
- **Headers**: No content in headers/footers
- **Sections**: Standard section names (Professional Summary, Experience, Skills, Education)
- **Bullets**: Standard bullet points only
- **Metrics**: Always quantify achievements

## File Organization:
```
data/               # YAML source files (edit these)
generators/         # Python modules (don't edit unless debugging)
scripts/           # Main entry point scripts
output/            # Generated .docx files
  versions/        # Timestamped backups
config/            # Configuration files
docs/              # Documentation
```

## Development Workflow:
1. User updates YAML files in `data/`
2. User runs "update resume" command
3. System generates .docx with ATS validation
4. User reviews output in `output/Resume_Kushal_Latest.docx`

## Quality Standards:
- All generated resumes must pass ATS validation (no errors)
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout
- Preserve user's sensitive AI/ML positioning
- Always create timestamped backup in versions/
- Quantify all achievements with metrics

## Common Commands:
- "update resume" → Regenerate from YAML data
- "validate resume" → Check ATS compliance
- "edit [section]" → Update specific YAML file
- "show resume data" → Display current YAML contents

## Dependencies:
- python-docx==0.8.11
- PyYAML==6.0.1
- python-dateutil==2.8.2

## Maintenance:
- Keep YAML files as single source of truth
- Always validate after generation
- Preserve versioned copies for rollback
- Update documentation when adding features
