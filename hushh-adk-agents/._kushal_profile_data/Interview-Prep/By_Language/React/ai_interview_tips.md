## Communication Strategies

### Speaking to AI

**Key Differences from Human Interviews:**
- AI may not respond to your questions
- Less conversational, more structured
- Pause before answering (AI may still be processing)
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Be concise but complete

### Best Practices

**1. Clear Articulation**
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Enunciate words properly
- Avoid filler words ("um", "uh", "like")
- Pause briefly between thoughts

**2. Structured Responses**
- Use STAR format for behavioral questions
- For technical questions: explain your thought process
- Start with a brief summary, then details
- End with a conclusion or takeaway

**3. Body Language**
- Maintain eye contact with camera (not screen)
- Sit up straight, show confidence
- Use natural hand gestures (but not excessive)
- Smile naturally when appropriate

**4. Time Management**
- Keep answers to 2-3 minutes for behavioral
- Technical explanations: 3-5 minutes
- Don't rush, but be mindful of time
- If you need to think, say "Let me think about that for a moment"

## Answering Questions

### Technical Questions

**Structure:**
1. **Understand**: Repeat question to confirm understanding
2. **Approach**: Explain your approach/strategy
3. **Solution**: Provide solution with code/explanation
4. **Trade-offs**: Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
5. **Optimization**: Mention how you'd improve it

**Example:**
> "The question is asking me to optimize a React component that's re-rendering too frequently. My approach would be to:
> 1. Identify what's causing re-renders
> 2. Use React DevTools Profiler
> 3. Apply appropriate optimizations (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
> 
> Here's how I would implement it: [explain solution]
> 
> Alternative approaches could be... [discuss trade-offs]
> 
> To further optimize, I would consider... [optimization ideas]"

### Behavioral Questions

**Use STAR Format:**
- **Situation**: Brief context (1-2 sentences)
- **Task**: What needed to be done (1 sentence)
- **Action**: What you did (3-5 sentences)
- **Result**: Outcome and impact (1-2 sentences)

**Keep to 2-3 minutes total**

### Code Questions

**If asked to write code:**
- Think out loud
- Explain your approach first
- Write clean, readable code
- Mention edge cases
- Discuss time/space complexity if relevant
- Explain how you'd test it

**If no code editor:**
- Describe the code structure
- Explain key functions/methods
- Use pseudocode if helpful
- Focus on logic and approach

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: No Feedback

**Problem:** AI doesn't give feedback or ask follow-ups

**Solution:**
- Don't wait for confirmation
- Continue with your answer
- Be thorough but concise
- Assume AI is listening/recording

### Challenge 2: Technical Difficulties

**Problem:** Camera/microphone/internet issues

**Solution:**
- Test everything beforehand
- Have backup plan (mobile hotspot)
- Contact support immediately if issues
- Stay calm, don't panic

### Challenge 3: Unclear Questions

**Problem:** Question is ambiguous or unclear

**Solution:**
- Restate question in your own words
- Make reasonable assumptions and state them
- Ask clarifying questions (even if AI doesn't respond)
- Provide answer based on most likely interpretation

### Challenge 4: Nervousness

**Problem:** Feeling nervous talking to AI

**Solution:**
- Practice talking to camera beforehand
- Record yourself answering questions
- Remember: humans will review, not just AI
- Take deep breaths
- Focus on content, not perfection
