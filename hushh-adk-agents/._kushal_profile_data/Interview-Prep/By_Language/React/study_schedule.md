- Write code from memory, then check against reference

### Practice Coding
- Use whiteboard or paper (simulates interview conditions)
- Time yourself (practice under pressure)
- Review solutions and understand trade-offs

### Behavioral Prep
- Write out full STAR stories
- Practice telling them out loud
- Keep stories concise (2-3 minutes each)
- Adapt stories to match company/role

### Time Management
- Take breaks every 60-90 minutes
- Review difficult concepts multiple times
- Focus on weak areas, but don't ignore strengths
- Get good sleep before interview day
