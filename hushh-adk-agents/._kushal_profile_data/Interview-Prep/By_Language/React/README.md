---

## Quick Start

### If you have 2-3 hours:
1. Review `quick_reference.md` - Last-minute cheat sheet
2. Practice 3-5 scenarios from `practice_scenarios.md`
3. Review behavioral questions in `behavioral_questions.md`

### If you have 1 day:
1. Follow `study_schedule.md` - Hour-by-hour breakdown
2. Read `technical_guide.md` - Comprehensive technical deep-dive
3. Complete practice scenarios
4. Prepare STAR format answers

### If you have multiple days:
1. Deep dive into `technical_guide.md`
2. Complete all practice scenarios
3. Build sample projects using concepts
4. Review and refine behavioral answers

## Last-Minute Checklist

Before any interview, quickly review:

- [ ] React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record)
- [ ] GraphQL query structure and mutations
- [ ] CSS Flexbox and Grid basics
- [ ] HTML semantic elements and accessibility
- [ ] 3-5 STAR format stories ready
- [ ] Common gotchas and best practices
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques

## Post-Interview

After each interview:

1. Fill out `assessment_notes.md` immediately
2. Record questions asked
3. Note areas that need improvement
4. Update prep materials based on learnings
5. Refine behavioral stories

---

## Good Luck!

Focus on understanding concepts deeply, not just memorizing. Be ready to explain your thought process and trade-offs.

Remember: These materials are designed to be reusable across any company. Adapt the domain-specific examples to match the company you're interviewing with!
