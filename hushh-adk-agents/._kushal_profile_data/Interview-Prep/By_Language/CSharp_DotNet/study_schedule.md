## Study Tips

### Active Learning

- Don't just read - code along with examples
- Explain concepts out loud (teach-back method)
- Write code from memory, then check against reference

### Practice Coding

- Trace through code examples mentally
- Time yourself on practice questions
- Review solutions and understand trade-offs

### Design Patterns

- Understand when to use each pattern
- Know the trade-offs
- Practice identifying patterns in code

### Time Management

- Take breaks every 60-90 minutes
- Review difficult concepts multiple times
- Focus on weak areas, but don't ignore strengths
- Get good sleep before interview day
