## 📖 Your Story (2 Minutes)

### **Opening**

---

### **Disney Star: The Foundation (4 Years)**

Over 4 years at Disney, I progressed to a **Senior Software Engineer role**, which gave me ownership to lead the **SharePoint Framework vertical** for the organization.

During my tenure, I worked on **over six B2B SharePoint projects**. Let me highlight my **two most significant achievements**:

**My approach:**

**Features we developed:**

- Season creation
- Auction for players
- Mapping them to the squad
- Creating matches and their start sheets
- Pre and post-match reporting
