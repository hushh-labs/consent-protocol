## Tonight's Plan (NOW - 10:00 PM)

### 5:30-7:00 PM: Study Patterns (90 min)

📖 Open: `Patterns/COMPLETE_STUDY_GUIDE.md`

**What to do**:

- Read through ALL 9 patterns (10 min each)
- Review templates
- See YOUR 18 problems listed under each pattern
- **Don't solve new problems** - just review

### 7:00-7:30 PM: Study Architecture (30 min)

📖 Open: `Architecture/ARCHITECTURE_BASICS.md`

**What to review**:

- 4+1 View Model
- NFRs (Scalability, Performance, Availability)
- Integration Patterns (API Gateway, Micro services)

### 7:30-8:00 PM: DINNER BREAK 🍽️

### 8:00-9:00 PM: Practice (60 min)

Pick 2 problems from `02_Problems_By_Pattern/`:

1. `Hash_Map/Two_Sum/` (Easy)
2. `Dynamic_Programming/Maximum_Subarray/` (Medium)

**Practice explaining OUT LOUD**:

- "This is a [pattern] problem because..."
- "My approach is..."
- Code it
- "Time is O(N), space is O(1) because..."

### 9:00-10:00 PM: Prep Environment

- Test HireVue link
- Check camera/mic
- Have `Patterns/PATTERNS_REFERENCE.md` bookmarked
- Set up quiet space

| "sorted"        | Two Pointers   |
| "substring"     | Sliding Window |
| "maximum"       | DP or Greedy   |
| "how many ways" | DP (Fibonacci) |
| "intervals"     | Sorting        |
| "kth largest"   | Heap           |
| "parentheses"   | Stack          |
