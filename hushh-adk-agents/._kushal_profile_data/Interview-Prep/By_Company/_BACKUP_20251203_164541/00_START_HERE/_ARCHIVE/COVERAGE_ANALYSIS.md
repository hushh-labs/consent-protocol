## Recommended Prioritization

### Phase 1: Critical (Must Do Before Dec 4)

1. **SQL Problems** - Practice 3-4 SQL problems (2-3 hours)
   - Second Highest Salary (#176)
   - Change Null Values (#2388)
   - Managers with 5+ Reports (#570)
2. **Sliding Window** - Add Longest Substring Without Repeating (#3) (30 min)

3. **High Frequency Easy** (1 hour)
   - Palindrome Number (#9)
   - Climbing Stairs (#70)
   - Reverse Linked List (#206)

### Phase 2: If You Have Time

4. **Medium Frequency** (2-3 hours)
   - Maximum Subarray (#53) - Important DP pattern
   - Merge Intervals (#56)
   - Group Anagrams (#49)

### Phase 3: Optional

- Edit Distance (#72) - Advanced DP
- Kth Largest Element (#215)
- 3Sum (#15)

---

## Your Current Position

### ✅ Strengths

- **100% coverage** on the #1 highest frequency problem (Merge k Sorted Lists)
- **Covered all 87.5% frequency algorithm problems**
- **Covered all 75% frequency algorithm problems**
- Strong on: Hash Map, Two Pointers, Stack, Greedy

### ⚠️ Gaps

- **0% SQL coverage** - This is your biggest gap!
- Missing Sliding Window (#3)
- Missing some easy DP (Climbing Stairs)
- Missing basic linked list (Reverse Linked List)

## Time Estimate to Close Critical Gaps

| Task                | Time      | Priority        |
| :------------------ | :-------- | :-------------- |
| SQL (3 problems)    | 2-3 hours | 🔴 CRITICAL     |
| Sliding Window (#3) | 30 min    | 🟡 Important    |
| Palindrome Number   | 15 min    | 🟢 Nice to have |
| Climbing Stairs     | 15 min    | 🟢 Nice to have |
| Reverse Linked List | 15 min    | 🟢 Nice to have |

**Total**: 3-4 hours to close the critical gaps.

---

## Verdict

**Your coverage is GOOD for algorithm problems (above average), but you MUST practice SQL.**

If you do just **SQL + Sliding Window**, you'll be at **80-85% coverage** for Deloitte, which is solid for Round 1.

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. Add `Sliding_Window/Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating/`
2. Practice 3 SQL problems
3. You're ready! 🚀
