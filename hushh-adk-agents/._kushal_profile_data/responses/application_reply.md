Hi Kino team,

**Who I am**  
Senior front-end engineer in San Mateo with 6+ years shipping production Next.js + React + Tailwind experiences for iWebtechno (https://www.iwebtechno.com, 7+ university modules on a custom Morphy UI system) and AI-powered credit scoring dashboards at https://credit.genzdealz.ai (7 OAuth providers, FastAPI backend). I build responsive, pixel-accurate UI systems, document design tokens, and keep shadcn/ui component libraries consistent while profiling React rendering to keep large data sets smooth.

**Why Kino**  
Kino’s Cursor-for-video vision mirrors my work integrating multi-provider data, asynchronous AI inference, and operator feedback loops into trustworthy interfaces. Your need for engineers who can render massive clip lists, maintain real-time Postgres sync, and evolve the Kino Agent aligns with my experience orchestrating FastAPI workers, vector scoring pipelines, and Next.js dashboards that stay swimmingly fast under load.

**How I build**  
Prototype quickly in Cursor with AI-assisted workflows, lock accessibility and responsiveness early, then wire APIs with clear contracts (FastAPI, Node.js services) and document reusable primitives so design-to-engineering handoff has zero friction. I treat every release as an extension of my personal brand, combining design fidelity with system-level rigor, enforcing testing (Playwright, Vitest) and observability around GPU-intensive tasks.

**Impact**  
Translate specs into production-grade Next.js + Tailwind UI that can display thousands of clips, build components that expose search quality, playback state, and edit context cleanly, and collaborate on-site in SF to prioritize features with founders and editors. I’m ready to help Kino deepen studio integrations, improve the chat-powered agent, and ship the next phase of consumer and enterprise video-editing experiences.
